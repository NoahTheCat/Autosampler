# Using the Sampler over the internet

By default the sampler is normally DISCONNECTED from the internet, and the main LED should be pulsing white (it's a RGB LED so you can still see the other colors a bit).

To connect the sampler to the internet press the Connect to Internet switch, the small LED near the USB connector should light up blue. At the next safe moment the sampler will try to connect to the internet.  The main LED will flash green while connecting to the local WiFi and then cyan when connecting to the device cloud.  When it has connected properly the main LED will slowly pulse cyan - it's like a very slow heartbeat.

**NOTE:** If you press the Connect To Internet switch and the sampler is due to fill a big within the next 10 minutes the sampler will NOT connect until the bag has filled.  This is so that you have enough time to turn it off/reset the sequence if something goes wrong.
