# Basic Operation

Assuming you're got a finished and working sampler...

Here are the simplest possible instructions for how to use your sampler

1. Fill the sampler with empty bags
2. Turn the power off then on again - this resets the sampler to fill from bag #1
2. Set the fill repeat time (e.g. fill every 1hr), and start time (e.g. start in 1 day from now) using the [buttons on the device](link)
3. Start the sampler either manually by pressing button `C` five times ([link](link)).
4. Done! ðŸŽ‰
