# Logging sampling data to the SD card

If there is an SD card present in the device , the sampler will automatically save the time and bag number every time a bag is filled. The time recorded will be the time that the pumps were started.

The data is saved into a text file on the card with a new line for each sample.  If the file gets too full for the  SD card to use it will create a new file and start daving the data there instead.

**Insert screenshot of file opened in a text editor**
