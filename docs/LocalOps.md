# Using the Sampler in-person

All basic things can be done by pressing the buttons next to the LCD screen.  When you first tun the sampler on the screen should look like this:

In general:

- the text on the top line is affected by pressing button A, 

- the middle line is controlled by pressing B
- the bottom line is controlled by pressing C

## Running the Sampling Sequence

### Starting the Sampler

If you are happy with the Repeat and Begin times and want to start the sampler press C five times fast. The screen should now look like this:

### Stopping the Sampler

The sampling sequence can be stopped at any time by pressing button C five (5) times fast.
