# How to set up the WiFi connection

**Academic/Public WiFi Networks have a tendancy to break things!**

**If at all possible only use a private WiFi network where you only need the Network Name and Password to login.**

**For remote sampling sites either use a cellular WiFi donlge, OR replace the Argon (WiFi) microcontroller with a Boron (2G/3G cellular)**

The easiest way to get the device online is to set it up using the Particle app on an apple iOS device (iPhone, iPad etc).

There is a way to make it work using a custom website for any phone/computer - that's on the todo list, but not started yet.



## How to do it

1.  Put the device into listening mode by holding the `SETUP` button for three seconds, until the RGB LED begins blinking blue.
2. Open the Particle app, log into the group's account and select add new device.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions.
4.  At one point the app will ask for the device name.  This *should* already be filled in. If not add the device's existing name (e.g. this one is called (Autosampler_1_WiFi)
5.  Done.



## Deleting all WiFi credentials

Deleting all old WiFi credentials can sometimes help stop problems if the device tries to connect to a WiFi network you don't expect.

To erase the stored Wi-Fi networks on your device, hold the `SETUP` button until it blinks dark blue, then continue to hold it down for about ten seconds longer, until the RGB LED blinks blue rapidly, then release.
