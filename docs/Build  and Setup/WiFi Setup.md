# How to set up the WiFi connection

The easiest way to get the device online is to set it up using the Particle app on an apple iOS device (iphone, iPad etc).

There is a way to make it work using a website for any phone/computer and that's on the plan, but it's not working right now.



## How to do it

1.  Put the device into listening mode by holding the `SETUP` button for three seconds, until the RGB LED begins blinking blue.
2. Phone
3. connect



## Deleting all WiFi credentials

Deleting all old WiFi credentials can sometimes help stop problems if the device tries to connect to a WiFi network you don't expect.

To erase the stored Wi-Fi networks on your device, hold the `SETUP` button until it blinks dark blue, then continue to hold it down for about ten seconds longer, until the RGB LED blinks blue rapidly, then release.
