# Basic Operation

1. Fill the sampler with empty bags
2. Turn the power off then on again - this resets the sampler to fill from bag #1
2. Set the fill repeat time (e.g. fill every 1hr), and start time (e.g. start in 1 day from now) using the [buttons on the device](link)
3. Start the sampler either manually by pressing button `C` five times ([link](link))
4. Done! ðŸŽ‰
