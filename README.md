# Autosampler

Equipment to pump air into FlexFoil bags(or anything else). It was developed to take repeated atmospheric air samples at remote locations to study global greenhouse gas emissions.

The kit can be programmed to take air samples at pre-defined times, or can be operated remotely to fill bags on command.

**Warning**
I'm sorry. The code in this repo is hideous. 
It was primarily written on the couch by a sleep deprived parent during nap-time.  
If you want to improve it, please do! 

## Description
Code for a Particle Argon/Boron, basic design files, BOM, etc. to build the autosampler

For ease of insatllation all the code is in a single file. 
This was a deliberate choice, rather than putting functions into separate files, to make installation as simple as possible for users new to coding. 

## Installation
**add screenhots, make this better, etc. etc.**
If you know how to use the Visual Studio desktop client you can figure it our by yourself!
For others, here's a simple installation using the online Particle code editor.

- Log into your Particle code editor (build.particle.com)
- Create a new app 
- Add the libraries at the top of the file (list!)
- Replace the contents of the file that the editor creates with the code here (just copy & paste)
- upload to you microcontroller
